EDIT PAYLOAD
------------

- Selecting this option will let you edit the selected payload.

- If you leave the payload as default or edit the payload and then select the 'OK' option,
  the contents of the edited payload will be saved to /payloads/exports/.

- Selecting the 'CANCEL' option will close the EDIT PAYLOAD window without saving a file.

- If any notes exist for the selected payload, they will be displayed before the edit box
  appears.

- The payload notes have been taken straight from the HAK5 Wiki and are presented exactly
  as written by their respective authors. Some may have been slightly edited for spelling
  and grammar as necessary.

--------------
ENCODE PAYLOAD
--------------

- Selecting this option will let you encode the selected payload.

- An edit box with a default location of /media/ is presented for exporting the encoded payload.
  In a typical situation, you should enter the full path to the SD card that is being used by the
  USB Rubber Ducky.

- A payload can be encoded to any valid folder location aside from an SD card if so desired.

- If a payload has not been modified with 'Edit Payload' then the default payload will be encoded to the
  path entered in the input box.

--------------
DELETE PAYLOAD
--------------

- Selecting this option will confirm wether or not you wish to delete the selected payload that has been
  exported to /payloads/exports/.

- You may wish to do this if you wish to edit the default payload from scratch and save it again to the
  /payloads/exports/ folder.
