------------
EDIT PAYLOAD
------------

- Selecting this option will let you edit the selected payload.

- If you leave the payload as default or edit the payload and then select the 'OK' option,
  the contents of the edited payload will be saved to /payloads/exports/.

- Selecting the 'CANCEL' option will close the EDIT PAYLOAD window without saving a file.

--------------
ENCODE PAYLOAD
--------------

- Selecting this option will let you encode the selected payload.

- An edit box with a default location of /media/ is presented for exporting the encoded payload.
  In a typical situation, you should enter the full path to the SD card that is being used by the
  USB Rubber Ducky.

- A payload can be encoded to any valid folder location aside from an SD card if so desired.

- If a payload has not been modified with 'Edit Payload' then the default payload will be encoded to the
  path entered in the input box.

--------------
DELETE PAYLOAD
--------------

- Selecting this option will confirm wether or not you wish to delete the selected payload that has been
  exported to /payloads/exports/.

- You may wish to do this if you wish to edit the default payload from scratch and save it again to the
  /payloads/exports/ folder.
